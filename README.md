# weatherapp

A weather app using Cubit

## Getting Started

In this project I am using two api to create this app

- first api give me the lat and lan of a place by it's name
- second api give me the weather data of the place from tha lat and lan

So after getting the lat and lan from the fiest api I have to send the data to the second api and get the weather details.And then I display it in the UI.

After clicking on the settings icon you can change the unit celsius to fahrenheit
